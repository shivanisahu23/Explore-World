# Country Explorer

## Project Overview

**Country Explorer** is a web application that allows users to explore information about different countries around the world. It fetches data from the [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to display details such as population, region, capital, and more. Users can search for countries, filter them by region, and mark their favorite countries (up to 5 favorites). The application also includes a dark mode feature and a modal to view more detailed information about each country.

## Features
